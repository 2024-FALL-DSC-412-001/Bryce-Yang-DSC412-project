# DSC412-project

## NOTE FOR MILESTONE 3:

This project was not done in a jupyter notebook, but is contained within the main.py python file. Currently the project runs with OpenCV's computer vision model, but I plan on transitioning to a less abstracted package in order to improve understanding.

The frontend/backend of this website is handled through the streamlit package, and OpenCV is used for the computer vision aspect.

### Run:

Create a virtual environment with

`python -m venv ./.venv`

Then activate it in terminal:

Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

Mac: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`

Linux: `source ./.venv/bin/activate`

Make sure you're working in the venv environment

then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Activate webapp

Type command:

'streamlit run main.py'

Allow streamlit access as prompted

Ignore the test video, will replace when needed.
